## Planning and Testing:
<p> The planning began by sketching the website on paper and then led to creating the wireframes. Creating the wireframes really helped me plan this project. It layed out what I wanted to achieve and you could visually see what would work and what wouldn't work.</p>
<p> I started by adding the basic strucutre to the html and then adding my placeholder cards and styling the grid. I then continued onto each section seperatly using a check list to make sure I was making progress and not vering from the overall objectives.</p> 
<p> I then selected the desired images to use for the cards, to really portray the theme of the game.</p>
<p> A part of my planning was using <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">coolors</a> to chose the correct colour palette.</p>

#### Feature Testing:

### Testing 
<p>
</p>

### Bugs
<p>
#1 after completing a game, restartin you could no longer click a card because the cards array was not being emptied.

possible side case being, if playing mulitple games in a row array could fill as no clearing, would break game.
